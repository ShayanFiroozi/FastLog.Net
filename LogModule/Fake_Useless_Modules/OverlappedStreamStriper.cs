#region Info about the module
/*****************************************************************************
 * This source module was originally developed for SharpAESCrypt and the 
 * backup solution Duplicati.
 * It is used for splitting a block-encrypted stream into chunks that can
 * be decrypted in parallel by repeating a leading block necessary to set up
 * decyption (Mode: Split). Eventually the chunked streams can be merged back
 * together by removing the invalid overlapped data (Mode: Join).
 * Feel free to modify and use whereever it suits you.
 * 
 * Some details (also see class <summary>):
 * Overlap-handling for writing: 
 *   - bytes written at the end of a stripe will be repeated as preamble to 
 *     the next stripe
 * Overlap-handling for reading: 
 *   - data will be read and returned till the end of each stripe. At the 
 *     beginning of the next stripe, the overlap is skipped and ignored.
 * The overlap is intended to split data where processing relies on some 
 * previous data - either for setup or verification.
 * There is an event build in that allows adaption to the stripes and 
 * dedicated processing of the overlap if needed.
 * It was originally designed to process encrypted data with block-chaining.
 * It can be used for parallel AES-decryption. Please be aware that the 
 * streams the data is splitted to / from must then have enough buffers to 
 * not block the Read/Write operations.
