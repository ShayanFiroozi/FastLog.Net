## ‚ùî How To Use


## ‚ùì How It Works


## ‚ùå Limitations

- However the **FastLog.Net** is thread-safe BUT it is **NOT** recommended to build two agents with same logging file , so this limitation applied to the FastLog.Net intentionally to prevent two or more agents write and manage the same logging file.

- The **FastLog.Net** queue has been limited to handle up to the **1,000,000** logging events at the same time.This limitation has been set to prevent uncontrolled memory usage.
